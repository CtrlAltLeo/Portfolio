# Hello!

My name is Leo Devick and I am a junior student of Computer Engineering with a 
minor in Mathematics at the University of Mary in sunny North Dakota! 

This git repository showcases some of the projects, assignments and papers
I'm most proud of from my time both in school and working independantly.
